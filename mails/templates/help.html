                        <strong>rmd.io</strong> is a service, which reminds you of unanswered e-mails and helps you to manage delegated tasks.<br>
                        For example: If you send an e-mail to '5d@rmd.io', then we'll send you the e-mail back 5 days later. This also works by using 'w' for weeks and 'm' for months.

                    <h4>Why should I use the anti-spam measure?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The anti-spam measure feature protects you from receiving spam mails. If you enable it, you won't get any e-mails from faked senders.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What does it do?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The anti-spam measure generates a personal anti-spam key. It checks whether the key from the e-mails sender is equal to the user key. If that isn't the case, the e-mail is dropped.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How can I use it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        At first, you have to enable the anti-spam measure feature in your settings. The settings can be found at the drop-down navigation in the upper right corner.<br>
                        After enabling it, you can download a custom vCard file with a subset of all possible addresses.<br>
                        If you don't use an address from the address book, then you have to manually include the key into the rmd.io e-mail address (e.g. 2d.jszelaigdj@rmd.io).

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <h4>What is the additional addresses feature for?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Additional addresses allow you, to add more than one address, from where you can send e-mails to rmd.io.<br>
                        No need to register multiple times, but still use rmd.io for all your e-mail addresses.
                    </p>
                    <h4>How can I use it?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Go to your settings and type an additional address into the form and click save. You will receive a confirmation e-mail with a confirmation link.
                        Please click the link to finally enable the additional address.
